# Description

Welcome!

We are very pleased to hired as Junior Data Scientist here at My MobApp Studio. As I told you during your very first interview, data science is very new for us but you succeeded to convinced that it's one of the key factor to be successful in our digital world, as you said: data is life.

Last management meeting, we decided we will allocate resource to create a new mobile app and I have to say that I have already received multiple emails showing the enthusiasm from our employees who wants to be part of the team. We have all in-house the different skills we need to make this project a success (marketing, design, game design, software engineer)

Before moving forward, I will need a report on the market. In order to complete our portfolio, this new App will be first publish on the Google Play Store, so you can focus your research on it.

I will just shoot some questions here:

What is the size of the market? numbers of download and $
Same question but per category? (percentages please)
Depending on each category, what are the ratio of download per app?
Any additional information you will find useful for us to take the right decision.
I remembered you told me you are also a developer, I'm myself an old developer, so I'm thinking maybe if you can build some code it would be great and display your results on the terminal.

I will invite my vp marketing and vp designer to the meeting, formatting will be a real plus, and if they have additional questions be ready to jump back in the code.

Best, John

We are expecting two files:

First will be your notebook jupyter with your calculation You will have to implement multiple functions:
load_dataset()
Analysis

You can inspire yourself from this very interesting blog post on kubernetes.

You are in data science, so your blog post needs to report as a "scientific experiment"; you need to write your assumption, every step of the experiment, and the conclusion. Usually, with an opening to what you follow, what to experiment next?

We will use this data set: Data set
