# Welcome to My Mobapp Studio

## Task
Basically, we had a little problem with the “Best Apps” type, and we thought about it a lot, made different decisions.

## Description
We found out our problem, found it mainly on YouTube and Google and on different sites

## Installation
To ensure everything worked efficiently and without problems, we installed numpy, pandas, seaborn and matplotlib!
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
```

## Usage
Our direction included downloading data from Google Play Store applications and using data analysis tools from the NumPy, Seaborn and Matplotlib libraries to use them. By downloading these tools, we were able to gain obvious insights into the data and make meaningful answers.
```
jupyter notebook --no-browser
```
