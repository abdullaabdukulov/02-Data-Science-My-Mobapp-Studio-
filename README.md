Depending on each category, what are the ratio of download per app?
Any additional information you will find useful for us to take the right decision.
I remembered you told me you are also a developer, I'm myself an old developer, so I'm thinking maybe if you can build some code it would be great and display your results on the terminal.

I will invite my vp marketing and vp designer to the meeting, formatting will be a real plus, and if they have additional questions be ready to jump back in the code.

Best, John
